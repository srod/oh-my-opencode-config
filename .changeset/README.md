# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## Usage

```bash
bunx changeset        # Create a new changeset
bunx changeset version # Apply changesets to bump versions + update CHANGELOG
bunx changeset publish # Publish to npm
```
